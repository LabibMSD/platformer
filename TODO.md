# TODO: Implement Running Mechanic in PlayerController

- [ ] Add public float runSpeed = 12.0f; to PlayerController.cs
- [ ] Modify Update method to calculate currentSpeed based on Shift key press
- [ ] Update movement vector calculations to use currentSpeed instead of speed
- [ ] Test the changes (run the game and verify running works with Shift)
